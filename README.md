Core Technology Cluster definition
------------------------
The core technology clusters are managed by WASP students.
They will typically be focused on some core technology, theory, tool, or method
that several PhD students are interested in and need to learn more about.

 + Are of the order of 10 students, including affiliated, and can be compared to a paper reading group or study circle.
 +  Have regular meetings, predominantly virtual.
 + Are managed by a senior WASP PhD student or a WASP postdoc.
 +  Have a lifetime that may vary from a single semester to the lifetime of WASP.
 + May organize study trips during years 3-4.
